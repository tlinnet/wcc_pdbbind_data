PART I. Introduction to the PDBbind database 

The aim of the PDBbind database is to build a comprehensive collection of 
the experimentally measured binding affinity data for all types of biomolecular
complexes deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). It provides an essential 
linkage between energetic and structural information of these complexes, which 
is helpful for various studies on molecular recognition occurred in biological 
systems. 

The PDBbind database was originally developed in Prof. Shaomeng Wang's group
at the University of Michigan. Upon a mutual agreement, this database is
further developed and now maintained by Prof. Renxiao Wang's group at the 
Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The 
PDBbind database is now updated on an annual base to keep up with the growth 
of the Protein Data Bank. 

This release contains PDBbind version 2017, which is based on the contents of 
PDB officially released by Jan 1st, 2017. This release provides binding data of 
a total of 17,900 biomolecular complexes, including protein-ligand (14,761), 
nucleic acid-ligand (121), protein-nucleic acid (837), and protein-protein 
complexes (2,181), which is the largest collection of this kind. Compared to 
the last release (v.2016), binding data included in this release have increased
by ~l1%. All binding data are curated by ourselves from over 32,000 original 
references. 

In addition to this data package, the users can also access the PDBbind 
database through a web portal at http://www.pdbbind-cn.org/.

PART III. Processed structural files of protein-ligand complexes

This data package also includes processed "clean" structural files for most 
protein-small ligand complexes in the "general set". These structural files 
can be readily utilized by most molecular modeling software. In this package, 
such structural files of 11,965 complexes are provided. An index of these 
complexes is given as "INDEX_structure.2017" under the "index/" directory. 

Note that: 
(a) Only the complexes formed by proteins and small-molecule ligands are 
    considered here. Other types of complexes, e.g. protein-protein
    and protein-nucleic acid complexes are not considered (sorry!) 
(b) A number of the protein-ligand complexes included in the general set 
    have some serious problems in their structures. Thus, such entries are not 
    included in this set.

Each complex is processed by the following methods:

(1) Each complex is saved in a subdirectory named after its PDB code:

    e.g. 1bxo/

    It is split into a protein molecule saved in the PDB format:

    e.g. 1bxo_protein.pdb

    and a ligand molecule saved in the Tripos Mol2 format and the MDL SDF 
    format:

    e.g. 1bxo_ligand.mol2 & 1bxo_ligand.sdf

    For convenience in display or analysis, another PDB file includes only 
    the binding pocket, i.e. all residues within 10A from the ligand. 

    e.g. 1bxo_pocket.pdb

(2) The protein molecule normally contains a complete "biological unit". 
    Exceptions are made only if the biological unit is too large (>3000 
    residues). In such cases, only the peptide chains that are relevant to 
    ligand binding (within 10A from the ligand) are kept. Structure of the 
    biological unit of each complex was also downloaded from PDB WITHOUT 
    furhter modifications. Note that a small number of biological units given 
    by PDB are actually problematic, but we did not attempt to fix them to 
    be consistent with PDB.  

(3) Both the protein and the ligand keep their original coordinates from PDB. 
    Hydrogen atoms are added to both molecules using stardard bond lengths 
    and bond angles. Coordinates of all atoms, including non-hydrogen atoms 
    and hydrogen atoms, have NOT been further optimized so that they are the 
    same as those in the original PDB files. 

(4) When adding hydrogen atoms to the protein and the ligand, a "default" 
    (or naive) protonation scheme under neutral pH condition are applied to 
    both molecules. On the protein side, Asp, Glu, and His residues are 
    deprotonated; while Lys and Arg residues are protonated; on the ligand 
    side, carboxylic, sulfonic, and phosphoric acid groups are deprotonated; 
    while aliphatic amine groups, guanidine and amidine groups are protonated.

(5) For each protein molecule, all of the atoms are re-numbered continuously 
    starting from 1 for the sake of convenience. But their residue numbers 
    and chain labels remain the same as those in the original PDB files. 
    Metal ions and water molecules are saved with the protein molecule in 
    the HETATM section. 

(6) The chemical structure of each ligand molecule was interpreted with a 
    special computer program based on the original PDB file. It was then 
    examined manually to correct atom/bond types if necessary. Gasteiger-Huckel
    partial charges are assigned on each ligand molecule.

Note that If the ligand molecule in a complex is a peptide, it could be 
arguable if this complex should be classified as a "protein-ligand complex" or 
a "protein-protein complex". By our definition, a valid "protein-protein" 
complex should consist of at least two different protein molecules, each of
which has at least 20 residues. If either molecule is a peptide shorter than 
20 residues, it is classified as a "protein-ligand complex".

PART IV. Description of the "refined set"

As an additional value of PDBbind, some protein-ligand complexes are selected 
to form a special data set, namely the "refined set". This data set aims at 
providing a better-quality basis for docking/scoring studies. It is compiled
by removing the protein-ligand complexes included in the general set that
have obvious problems in 3D structure, binding data, or other aspects. 

Note that the "refined set" should not be interpreted as a high-quality data
set. It is compiled with the commonsense of computational medicinal chemists
and aims at providing an easy starting point for most researchers. Other 
researchers, if necessary, are certainly welcome to apply even more strigent 
rules to compile their own data sets based on PDBbind. 

A number of filtering rules are applied to sample selection. Complexes of the 
following types are NOT accepted into the "refined set":

(1) Concerns on the quality of structures  

    (a) It is not a crystal structure, resolution>2.5A, or R-factor>0.250.
    (b) The ligand is bound to the protein through a covalent bond.
    (c) It is a ternary complex, i.e. multiple ligands binding at the same site.
    (d) Obvious steric clashes (<2.0A) exist between ligand and protein.
    (e) Ratio of the buried solvent-accessible surface of the ligand <15%.
    (f) Non-standard residues are in direct contact with the ligand, or there
        are missing fragments on the backbone or sidechain of any pocket
        residue.
    (g) The ligand contains uncommon elements, such as B, Be, Si, and metal.
    (i) There is missing fragment on the ligand structure. 
    (h) Molecular weight of the ligand >1000 if it is a regular organic 
        molecule, or it contains >=10 residues if it is a peptide or peptide 
        mimic.

(2) Concerns on the quality of binding data

    (a) The binding data are given as IC50 value rather than Kd and Ki.
    (b) The binding data are not exact values, e.g. Kd~1pM, Ki<10uM.
    (c) The binding data fall out of the desired range, i.e. logKa<2.00 
        (Kd>10mM) or logKa>=12.00 (Kd<=1pM).
    (d) The protein used in binding assay does not match the one in crystal
        structure, e.g. of different subtypes, mutants, or species.
    (e) The ligand used in binding assay does not match the one in crystal
        structure, e.g. in different forms or having missing fragments. 
    (f) The protein binds with two ligand molecules at two binding sites, 
        which are associated with two binding constants, e.g. Kd1 and Kd2, 
        and they are significantly different (>10 folds).

Details of the latest set of rules are described in the following publication: 
Li, Y. et al. J. Chem. Inf. Model., 2014, 54, 1700-1716. 

In this release, the "refined set" is composed of 4,154 selected protein-ligand
complexes. Note that some entries included in the previous version of refined 
set are removed from this version due to a more systematic (and thus more 
strict) application of the above rules.

Part V. Regarding the core set

In previous releases of PDBbind (up to v.2016), another special data set, 
i.e. the "core set", is also included. Compilation of the "core set" aims 
at providing a relatively small set of high-quality protein-ligand complexes 
with emphasis on diversity in structures and binding data. It may serve as 
a standard test set for docking/scoring studies. 

In particular, the "core set" serves as the primary test set in our 
Comparative Assessment of Scoring Functions (CASF) benchmark. Basically, 
the "core set" is selected as a representative, non-redundant subset of the 
"refined set". The latest methods for compiling this data set can be found 
in our publications.

(3) Cheng,T.J. et al. J.Chem.Inf.Model., 2009,49,1079-1093. (CASF-2007)

The "core set" is used primarily by our CASF project, and thus it is not 
updated on an annual base as the PDBbind database itself. Besides, the 
"core set" is much more than a list of protein-ligand complexes. A huge amount
of derivative data is associated with it. Therefore, we have decided to isolate
the core set from the PDBbind package starting from this release (v.2017). 
Other researchers may download the CASF data package for instead to obtain 
the core set. The complete CASF data package is available for downloading 
at our PDBbind-CN web site at http://www.pdbbind-cn.org/casf.asp.

For your information, the latest "core set" is v.2016, which is compiled 
based on the contents of PDBbind v.2016. This data set is composed of 285 
protein-ligand complexes in 57 clusters. It has been employed in our CASF-2016 
benchmark.
